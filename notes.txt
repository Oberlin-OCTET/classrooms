3/17-08 Fixed problem with advanced search not being able to search by room number
Changed line 26 from
		$sql_str .= " AND RoomNumber = '$room'"; }
to
		$sql_str .= " AND RoomNumber LIKE '%$room%'"; }//changed EQUAL to LIKE & added % around $room
We still need to fix the fact that the Rooms schedules for those that were changed doesn't show when we click on the room.
Add a search by faculty feature.

The image reference was hard coded into the RoomBuilding field.  The html and the reference to the actual image were all part of that 
field.  I added 2 fields. The first indicates whether an image exists. The second is a building code w/o spaces. The building code 
was used to reference the images which were named with BuildingCode + RoomNumber.jpg.

The code in Index.php then needed to be adjusted. This was done with an if statement added to the middle of each .$results section
line 82 and 119.  If the image field contained a 1, there was an image and the appropriate html was generated so that the image would 
appear.

--Would like to be able to search for 'other rooms with DVD players' by having links on the pages that say what equipment they have in them
such as 1) Results page and 2) the individual room schedules
